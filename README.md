# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivam Wagle

I’m a Web Developer and DevOps beginner who actually builds things instead of just watching tutorials. I focus on writing clean code, deploying real projects, and solving problems without drama.

## 🔧 Skills I Use
- Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudFront, RDS)
- Tools: Linux, Git, VS Code
- Other: SQL, API integration, debugging

## 🔥 Projects

### ✅ Foodie Web App
A full-stack restaurant review app.  
I handled frontend, backend, and all AWS infrastructure.
- Hosted on EC2
- Images on S3
- DB on RDS
- CloudFront for CDN
- IAM for secure access

This project shows that I can build and deploy end to end.

### ✅ Mini Web Projects
Small practice apps built to sharpen my basics.  
Check the repos for code, commits, and structure.

## 🎯 What I’m focusing on right now
- Kubernetes fundamentals
- Cleaner deployments
- Building a complete portfolio
- Strengthening backend skills
